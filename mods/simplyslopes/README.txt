Simply Slopes 0.2.2
by Delaroyas

This mod has been created by Delaroyas to include slopes, corner slopes etc...

Description:
Adds 5 new craftable block types to minetest. Slopes and slope corners. Supports 
multiple types of blocks from different mods.

The goal of this mod was to make my first mod, to get familiar with minetest programming.
There were similar (identical) blocks in moreblocks, but if you are looking for a light mod that just adds a few slopes, This is the mod for you.

Mod dependencies: default
Compatible mods: lapis, bakedclay, wool, mobs, castle, homedecor, moretrees, ethereal, xanadu. 
Minetest version tested: 0.4.13 and 0.4.13-dev
