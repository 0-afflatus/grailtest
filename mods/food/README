grailtest 0.4 mod: food
========================

This mod provides basic food recipes including a feast of nonvegan ones if you have mobs installed.

APIish
------

Food preparations intended for cooking in the cauldron must use shapeless recipes to produce a cookable craft item.

For example, to make vegetable stew:
Craft a vegetable, grain,  AND {pulse OR nut OR edible_mushroom} to make prepped veg.
The prepped veg can then be cooked in a furnace to make vegetable stew
or you can do the thing all in one go by crafting the ingredients in a cauldron.
