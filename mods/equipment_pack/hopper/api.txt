Hopper API
----------

This API is kept simple by adding a single command which allows mods to add
containers like chests and furnaces to the hopper check list.


Command Usage
-------------

Make sure any mods using this function has 'hopper' in the depends.txt file.

hopper:add_container({ {"where_from", "node_name", "inventory_name"} })

  'where_from' is a string telling the api that items are coming from either
               the 'top' node into a hopper below, going into the 'bottom' node
               from the hopper above or coming from a 'side' hopper into the
               node next door.

  'node_name"  is the name of the container itself (e.g. "default:chest")

  'inventory_name' is the name of the container inventory that is affected.

e.g.

hopper:add_container({
	{"top", "default:furnace", "dst"}, -- take cooked items from above into hopper below
	{"bottom", "default:furnace", "src"}, -- insert items below to be cooked from hopper above
	{"side", "default:furnace", "fuel"}, -- replenish furnace fuel from hopper at side
})


We already have support for the wine barrel inside of the Wine mod and protected
chests inside of Protector Redo, as well as default chests, furnaces and hoppers
themselves.

Note: Hoppers can transfer into locked chests but not take from them (yet).
